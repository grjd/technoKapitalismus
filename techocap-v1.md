# From Teruel Curso de Verano Is technology killing capitalism
# Is capitalism compatible with democracy? Wolfgang Merkel
Capitalism and democracy follow very different logic, distributed proeperty rights vs political rights.
the finanialitation of the 80s has broken down the fragile compromises built in the social democracy era to oppose the red peril.
Socioecnomic inequality has risen intra nations but decrease inter nations, globally.
Historical evidence also confirms that no developed democracy could exist without capitalism. Vice versa this is not the case. Nazi Germany, China and Singapore and latin american dictatorships prove that capitalism can coexist without democracy.
If democracy then capitalism
But Capitalism does not imply democracy  
Therefore democracy does not cause capitalism there are other "confounding " factors that can take us to capitalism without democracy, for example an authoritarian regime like Singapure or China.
Diminishing democracies  is a concept that has been promoted since the turn of the millenium (post democracies, defective democracies or mere facades) and capitalism is usually blame for this democratic decadence.
Financial capitalism in particular raises inequalities in income and political participation, curbs the powers of parliaments and seriously constrains the capacity to govern from national executives.
The 2008 and the subsequent Euro crises have changed the perception about the apparently complementary nature of democracy and capitalism.
We may talk about varieties of capitalism and varieties of democracy, this would make the dialogue inconclusive and unproductive, because there would be always a problem of capitalism choice "a la carte" to reach the chosen democratic status
$Capitalism = Democracy + \epsilon$

Types of Capitalism

At the core the distinctions are created on the differences between the relations between the market and the state.
Now it reigns neoliberal capitalism it imposed over Keynes managing capitalism through the demand side and Polanyi's embedded capitalism (Brettom Woods). von Hayek spontaneous order and Milton Friedman pledge for minimal state, the only interference would be in the supply of money.
the new phase of capitalism was characterized by deregulation, privatization and partial deconstruction of the welfare state.

The crash between capitalism and democracy comes mainly from this edges:
* capital gains, distribution and use of property rights lead to an accumulation of wealth large enough to hinder politics through capitalist pressure (the riches buy the votes of elected representative in the congress through lobbying and other forms of bribing)
* democratic decisions are taken to massively limit the use of property rights (the fear to forms of communism governance undertaken of private assets.  Italy post WWII politics is the perfect example to our days)

The dangerous contradiction between d & c is the following whereas certain forms of capitalism (unregulated) produce and function with an extreme concentration of wealth and capital (to its natural end, monopolistic), democracies cannot coexist with a similar constellation and concentration of power, because power can be bought.
"Democracy is subordinate to the market, democracy must adjust to the market."

the hallmarks of financial capitalism are speed, volume and complexity of transaction, parliamentary democracy has, on the contrary, inertia and larger time windows for the decision making, the market has also the upper hand, it acts and reacts faster, autonomoulsy (no time in the equation because is as fast as physics allow).
W. Scheuermann "empire of speed", Harmut Rosa "desynchromization"  (because was too fast, history very rarely repeats, financial capitalism is the play boy and democracy is the priest in rural Spain, the former is hardly predicable the later always follow the same pattern, he is slow, history repeats itself).
It is not only naive but ignorant on the laws of physics to assume that any political decision could keep pace with the speed of financial transactions.

 Revolutions – especially in the United States (1776) and France (1789) – helped to create the idea of a commonly defined ‘national interest’, while improved communications unified language, culture and identity.
 Imperialistic expansion spread the nation-state model worldwide and by mid 10th century was the only game in town. There are 193 states in the world. But for how long this anomaly will last? For a person living under roman law, the mighty roman
 empire would appear almost eternal (it lasted 1,000) years, or for a farmer in rural Bretagne the end of the Anciene regime a hard to      event, nobody either predicted the sudden end of the soviet bloc in 1989.

 The case against the nation state is hardly new, but interne t may have, this time be different.
Libertarian utopias for the XXIcentury are Liberland, which is uninhabited but has more than 100,000 online citizens ready to move if Croatia stops blocking inward access. The problem for Liberland is that the Croatian police could roll in any time they want. Seasteading Institute, on the other hand,  plans to build island cities inninternational watersand counts with $0.5M$ donated by Peter Thiel. Therewill create an archipuelago of seasteads all different in which "citizens" can swith from one to the next as they switch episodes of their favourite series in Netflix.

The booton line is Nation-states are unlikely to collapse overnight. There are no barbarians at the gate. But while the nation state served a time of industrialisation, centralised ‘command and control’ bureaucracies and national loyalty. Modern technology tends in the opposite direction: it’s distributed, decentralised and uncontrollable. If our political arrangements are a mirror of the modes of production and assumptions of the time, the future doesn’t look rosy for this 19th-century relic.

#reybrouck Case against elections
[Elections are bad for democracy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS9EMvbBq_U)
Democracy is 3,000 years old but elections(universal sufrage) are very recent (French revolution).
Draft people by law rather than election (sortition) For Aristotle draftig people bylaw is democratic electing them is aristocratic.
After the revolutions, those in power fear the rule of the mob, elections slow down democracy (rule of the poors) with the first elections only a few people could vote and less could be elected officials. Elections created a new elite, power remained in the hands of a minority but this time endowed with democratic legitimacy. In the XX, finally the entire population was granted the right to vote and run for office, but today this is not longer sufficient. We need not only vote every a few years (note the decalage between the speed here and the speed of finances, this can only bring dissatisfaction)but to take active part in governance.

 democracy is not compatible with capitalism, corporation toke too much control.

[Marc Andreessen]() coined the phrase “software is eating the world” The thesis is that  economic value was increasingly being captured by software-focused businesses disrupting a wide range of industry sectors.
Today, the world’s largest bookseller, Amazon, is a software company — its core capability is its amazing software engine for selling virtually everything online, no retail stores necessary.
Today’s dominant music companies are software companies.
Today’s largest video service by number of subscribers is a software company.
Today’s fastest growing entertainment companies are videogame makers — again, software.
Today’s largest direct marketing platform is a software company — Google.
Today’s fastest growing telecom company is Skype, a software company that was just bought by Microsoft for $8.5$ billion. Meanwhile, the two biggest telecom companies, AT&T and Verizon, have survived by transforming themselves into software companies, partnering with Apple and other smartphone.
LinkedIn is today’s fastest growing recruiting companies.
Software is also eating much of the value chain of industries that are widely viewed as primarily existing in the physical world.
Health care and education (highly resistant to entrepreneurial change, are primed for tipping by great new software-centric entrepreneurs), in my view, are next up for fundamental software-based transformation AND GOVERNANCE

[“All of a sudden you can program the world” — it’s the continuation of the software eating the world thesis we put out over five years ago, and of the trajectory of past and current technology shifts](https://a16z.com/2016/07/10/software-programs-the-world/)
Moore's law doesn't work as before making chips twice as faster for the same price every 1.5 years but it hasn't flip either, it continues but under a new form, halving the price, computing is getting essentially free, this has major consequences.
If every physical object in the world is going to be networked an smart because it will have a chip then you can program the world, write software that applies to homes, factories etc. using platforms (AWS) Massive deflation of hardware cost.

The rise of the GPU is finding uses in new fields, paralleling processes (vector processors existed before -Silicon graphics) 30 years later are up.
This was used for simulation of physical systems dynamics (fluid, flight etc) now the specs are for virtual digital systems (mining digital currency) and amazingly we have the same computational requirements. The simulation of the physical world and of the virtual world requires the same kind of computing architecture(do tons of maths in parallel).
If you can simulate the real world and run experiment and run consequences and counter factuals can determine the best course of action, it is cheaper and has no consequences (bank tests) model all the potential futures and pick up the best possible path.
