# From Teruel Curso de Verano Is technology killing capitalism
The end of work: Is technology killing capitalism?

Software is eating the world but before it needs to reprogram democracy.

Democracy, the government of the majority typically though elected representatives, is undergoing a major crisis.
Human societies have experimented with democracy since at least the fifth century BC in the polis of Athens.
Whether democracy is scalable is an open question, the current mistrust in democratic institutions and the rise of populism
could be directly linked with the scalability problems of democracy.
The majority rule is a powerful narrative that is fed every few years with elections. In "Against elections", the cultural historian Van Reybrouck claims that  elections were never meant to make democracy possible, rather the opposite, it was a tool designed for those in power to prevent "the rule of the mob".
Elections created a new elite and the power remained in the hands of a minority but this time, endowed with democratic legitimacy.
While it is unquestionably true that the universal suffrage has been entirely accomplished -though black male suffrage was amended as late as 1920 and women  in 1906 were allowed to vote only in country, Finland- the minority still rules at least if one pays attention to the immense role of political donors.
There are important historical precedents that show the power of minority to impose its own thinking against a more heterogeneous majority.
For example, as pointed out by Taleb, early christians were fanatically stubborn and they ended up imposing themselves over more numerous religious groups (NA. Taleb. Antifragility).
Another and more recent event that supports this point is tax evasions laws. For example, the European council lead by Monti, established that tax avoidance is a competition issue which means that it is subject to the unanimity rule in the Council. In practical terms, one member, let us say Ireland, can simply use the veto to block any changes that could undermine its own national interest.

The 2008 financial crisis have changed the perception about the once taken for granted complementary nature of democracy and capitalism. The
belief that capitalism and democracy go hand by hand is not credible anymore. The concept of nation is a fiction that needs to be believed in order to survive. A common language and shared cultural icons might fail to have the necessary cohesive power to resist the centrifugal forces that financial capitalism impinges upon the social fabric.
Financial capitalism raises wealth inequality and curbs the power of elected representative of democracies. If democracy is subordinated to the financial markets it can't survive.
Financial capitalism and democratic governance in its actual form are intrinsically incompatible. The hallmarks of financial capitalism are decentralisation, speed and informational efficiency. Parliamentary democracy on the contrary, carries over the inertia of ‘command and control’ bureaucracies and loyalty to historical myths (ie. the nation) that are exhausted. The current wave of nationalism and populism with if anything proves that human beings demand for control and understanding via narratives that speak to them.

Market capitalism, by design, has the upper hand over politics, because today's democratic governance can't possibly keep pace with the speed and complexity of financial transactions. The ideology that politics can and must tame financial capitalism is naive and delusional.
This is in connection to what social theorist refer to "time and space social compression", "empire of speed" or "desynchromization". The idea of desynchronization and can be explained via analogy. The faster the system is the less predictable because it will less rarely repeats itslef than a slow system.
If financial capitalism had to impersonated would be a play boy with a strenuous life style, his past is a bad predictor of his future, democratic governance, on the other hand, would a priest in rural Spain who tends to follow the same pattern, history repeats itself.

The fundamental problem of modern financial systems is that they are non self-regulating systems and left to their own devices will inevitably create debt in excessive quantities. Adair Turner has convincingly argued that financial stability in modern economies, lies the intersection between the infinite capacity of banks to create new credit, money, and purchasing power, and the scarce supply of irreproducible urban land.

Nation-states will not collapse over night, but they are an industrial-era device in a digital era. They need to change their operative system in order to deliver value. Since the venture capitalist Marc Andreessen coined the phrase “software is eating the world” the logic of financial capitalism has accelerated this trend. Five software companies: Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet (FANG) equal more than 10 per cent percent of the S&P 500. Todays's dominant industries in entertainment, retail, telecom, marketing companies etc. are software companies, software is also taking a bigger share in industries that traditionally exist in the physical space like automakers and energy.
Education and Health care have shown more resistance to software-based entrepreneurial change but a very profound transformation is underway this is quite visible with the growing popularity of MOOCs and personalized health monitoring systems.
 Software has a growing market share but mroe important than that it can reprogram the world. The internet of things will allow to have full connectivity of smart devices in a world with massive deflationary costs (computing will become  practically free). This has profound consequences for business, industry and mot importantly for how we, citizens, want to organize society and redesign governance.

A most promising innovation is the blockchain technology, an encrypted and distributed ledger system. Blockchain could become an universal and freely accessible repository of documents including property contracts publicly auditable, and resistant to special group interests manipulation and corruption. New kinds of governance models and services could be tested and implemented using the blockchain. The time is ripe for fundamental software-based transformation in governance. Democracy and free society will ignore this at its own peril.




Many new and different kinds of governance models and services
might be possible using blockchain technology. Blockchain governance takes advan‐
tage of the public record-keeping features of blockchain technology: the blockchain
as a universal, permanent, continuous, consensus-driven, publicly auditable, redun‐
dant, record-keeping repository. The blockchain could become both the mechanism
for governing in the present, and the repository of all of a society’s documents,
records, and history for use in the future—a society’s universal record-keeping sys‐
tem. Not all of the concepts and governance services proposed here necessarily need
blockchain technology to function, but there might be other benefits to implementing
them with blockchain technology, such as rendering them more trustworthy, and in
any case, part of a public record.

democracy is not compatible with capitalism, corporation toke too much control.

[Marc Andreessen]() coined the phrase “software is eating the world” The thesis is that  economic value was increasingly being captured by software-focused businesses disrupting a wide range of industry sectors.
Today, the world’s largest bookseller, Amazon, is a software company — its core capability is its amazing software engine for selling virtually everything online, no retail stores necessary.
Today’s dominant music companies are software companies.
Today’s largest video service by number of subscribers is a software company.
Today’s fastest growing entertainment companies are videogame makers — again, software.
Today’s largest direct marketing platform is a software company — Google.
Today’s fastest growing telecom company is Skype, a software company that was just bought by Microsoft for $8.5$ billion. Meanwhile, the two biggest telecom companies, AT&T and Verizon, have survived by transforming themselves into software companies, partnering with Apple and other smartphone.
LinkedIn is today’s fastest growing recruiting companies.
Software is also eating much of the value chain of industries that are widely viewed as primarily existing in the physical world.
Health care and education (highly resistant to entrepreneurial change, are primed for tipping by great new software-centric entrepreneurs), in my view, are next up for fundamental software-based transformation AND GOVERNANCE

collapse overnight. There are no barbarians at the gate. But while the nation state served a time of industrialisation, centralised ‘command and control’ bureaucracies and national loyalty. Modern technology tends in the opposite direction: it’s distributed, decentralised and uncontrollable.

This is because the hallmarks of financial capitalism are speed, volume and complexity of transaction, parliamentary democracy has, on the contrary, inertia and larger time windows for the decision making, the market has also the upper hand, it acts and reacts faster, autonomoulsy (no time in the equation because is as fast as physics allow).



The dangerous contradiction between d & c is the following whereas certain forms of capitalism (unregulated) produce and function with an extreme concentration of wealth and capital (to its natural end, monopolistic), democracies cannot coexist with a similar constellation and concentration of power, because power can be bought.

Capitalism and democracy follow very different logic, distributed property rights vs political rights.

Financial capitalism in particular raises inequalities in income and political participation, curbs the powers of parliaments and seriously constrains the capacity to govern from national executives.

 democracy is not compatible with capitalism, corporation toke too much control.





Democracy is 3,000 years old but elections(universal sufrage) are very recent (French revolution).
Draft people by law rather than election (sortition) For Aristotle drafting people bylaw is democratic electing them is aristocratic.
After the revolutions, those in power fear the rule of the mob, elections slow down democracy (rule of the poors) with the first elections only a few people could vote and less could be elected officials. Elections created a new elite, power remained in the hands of a minority but this time endowed with democratic legitimacy. In the XX, finally the entire population was granted the right to vote and run for office, but today this is not longer sufficient. We need not only vote every a few years (note the decalage between the speed here and the speed of finances, this can only bring dissatisfaction)but to take active part in governance.






The treaty of Westphalia in 1648 is the birth date of the nation state as we know it today.

In modern history, democracy goes hand by hand with the nation state.


It legimitimated states

Globalization made the "Westphalian" doctrine looked anachronistic (the end of the nation state narrative), transfer of nation state sovereign rights to supranational entities.


=============
Westphalian sovereignty or State sovereignty :
The "Westphalian" doctrine of states as independent agents was bolstered by the rise in 19th century thought of nationalism, under which legitimate states were assumed to correspond to nations—groups of people united by language and culture.

* Carta magna: contract of the barons to limit the power of the kings over the barons' plebes peasants
* merchants who had no political power first
* and then the proletariat after the enclosure laws began to organize
The state emerges as a mechanism to avoid conflict, reduce class tension

** Utopias
In More’s Utopia everything is ideal. There is no ownership: everyone lives in identical houses, but the houses are exchanged every ten years to dispel any notion that individuals own their homes
Bacon's new Atlantis: central to the culture of Bensalem is Salomon’s House, an institution devoted to science and the acquisition of new knowledge (Salomon’s House resembles in many ways a modern research institution
)
Hobbes: the first to seek for a Physics of Society. Hobbes imagined, as Bacon, utopia based on scientific reasoning. Hobbes’s Leviathan does not describe a society ready-made and shaped by the author preferences like Bacon and More do. He rather builds it up from his mechanistic view of how humans behave.

Hobbes traveled to Florence to meet Galileo. His epiphany came after reading Euclid’s elements of geometry According to historian Frederick Nussbaum, Hobbes discovered society

** Capitalism
Capitalism is an evolving system, as an organism adapts to the environment it creates
Innovation occurs always at the margins (cracks in the system)

The Goodhart’s law: Targeting any variable long enough undermines the value of the variable itself. Kalecki: once you target and sustain full employment over time (tight job market), it basically becomes costless for labor to move from job to job. Wages will have to continually rise to hold onto labor, and the only way business can accommodate that is to push up prices. This pushes inflation because prices and wages push each other up. In the 70s the end of Keynesianism with too much inflation (oil shock, end of the gold-dollar peg monetary system etc.) the system undermined itself

The new order is called neoliberalism. Over the next thirty years the world was transformed from a debtor’s paradise into a creditor’s paradise where capital’s share of national income rose to an all-time high as labor’s share fell as wages stagnated. Inflation acts as a tax on the returns on investment and lending. Unsurprisingly, in response, employers and creditors mobilized and funded a market-friendly revolution where the goal of full employment was jettisoned for a new target—price stability, aka inflation, to restore the value of debt and discipline labor through unemployment
Just as targeting full employment undermined itself, so did making inflation the policy target.

In a deflationary world, the debtors can’t pay the debt—and politically, and this is crucial— it empowers debtors since they can’t pay, won’t pay, and still have the right to vote

** Democracy
Plato was against democracy. Aristotle “democracy is the government of the poor (MAJORITY) and the free.
The minority rules at least if one pays attention to the immense role of political donors ( Koch brothers). Christians won because they were fanatically stubborn, romans, the majority could not resist the minority.  (NA. Taleb. Antifragility)

* (Tax evasions laws designed with this in minds (veto)) Tax avoidance is a competition issue and from that, taxation is subject to the unanimity rule in the Council, which means Ireland will simply veto everything, and therefore nothing will happen. (Mario Monti: was the first one to really suggest that tax avoidance is a competition issue)

** Secular stagnation
Theories:
* (Robert Gordon) supply side: a decline in the rate of productivity growth relative to the golden age 1870-1970
* The more productive you get the smaller % of the GDP you capture, for example agriculture was 80% of the GDP now is marginal, similarly this occurred for manufacturing
* Knowledge economy: marketing, persuasion, attention
World Inequality have diminished quite dramatically but  within countries is increasing. (Greenspan 1997) “Surveys suggest around a quarter of workers currently are afraid of losing their jobs, the highest level in several decades”

** How finantialization happened?
Bretton Woods recycling of surpluses and deficits to keep stable interest rates. In 1945 Europe that need to be rebuilt, the US was the surpluser, its surplus was went to Europe to be rebuilt, this keep the economy, globally, growing and stable. When Europe was rich and rebuilt, they started exporting themselves, the US became and importer. EU and China, Japan became the surplusers of the world, the surplus built the social well fare in Europe via Wall Street

The bank tale: : banks are places where people gather and bring money so that banks can lend it to someone else (take money from savers and lend it to business borrowers, allocating money among alternative capital investment projects). But this is fictitious, banks do not intermediate already existing money, but create credit, money, and purchasing power which did not previously exist EX NOVO. not support new business investment but instead funds either increased consumption or the purchase of already existing assets, in particular real estate and the urban land on which it sits

The fundamental problem is that modern financial systems are non self-regulating systems. Left to themselves inevitably create debt in excessive quantities. Financial stability in modern economies, lies the intersection between the infinite capacity of banks to create new credit, money, and purchasing power, and the scarce supply of irreproducible urban land. (Adair Turner)

Bubbles: Applied to the capital markets the term bubble is non-specific. Bubbles can be explained as positive feedback loop mechanisms and as such are essentially unstable. Biological and technical systems, on the other hand, operate using negative feedback to overlook stability and successful performance. Financial markets and the agents within, have no interest in the permanence nor the stability of the system, they rather look after the discovery of arbitrage opportunities to be exploited rapidly enough before equilibrium is reached.
Study bubbles not as harmful events that need to be anticipated and corrected by forecasters and regulators (with little success), but as self correcting mechanisms that could have beneficial effects. Neurobiologists have shown that stressful events (not chronic stress) produces neurogenesis, (proliferation of new brain cells) in the hippocampus, and in the dorsal dentate gyrus.

Ideally, capitalism would like to take labour out of laborers to do not have to deal with them (perfect commodification) the iron law of capitalism is commodification. Through technology, labour can be effectively taken from labourers.
The march of commodification aka exchange vale, against experiential or use value, the inexorable march of the commodity that takes over all goods to commodify them.

Special status of money: Money is a good and a commodity, it has a price (interest rate) and can be trade. But money is not as other commodities, the more I cheapen the price the more the other think it is preferable to keep it. Money is a second order commodity, that is, the decision of save or invest is always about future flow cash. Savers and investor are the same thing, they are both lenders, the Saver lends to herself and the investor to someone else.
Economic or financial decision making what really matters is the other's people mind problem.

That is why economics is SO HARD.

CODA: Planck confessed to Keynes that in his early life had thought of studying economics, but had found it too difficult!

Capitalism had socialism as its intellectual rival or dancing partner Stability loss. The IT will do what the left has failed to do, OVERTHROW capitalism.
Software spends far more of its time in a LOOP. Crafts professions are based on the loop, the repetitive pattern to the pursue of expertise (coders, pilots, surgeons) so do work (loop) to acquire some expertise and feed our families. Software is threatening not only low value repetitions but also high value REPETITION BEHAVIOR. A radiologist who has been trained for many years in order to make tricky diagnosis potentially will be obviated by a "deep learning“.
Professions that were not a zero sum game (you might not need to be the best doctor, just someone that knows ho to fix a leg) are indeed now following the same non-consensus approach, with purely survival gains. The only place where humans have some edge over machines, creativity spark, singular act, creation


** Alternatives for a better future
* Change the OS of the economy from going from an extractive to a distributive model
* crypto currency endogenous algorithms built in so when recession hits the increment the money supply and to contract later on without having political agendas of people at the helm
*
** What's money?
* Medium of exchange and repayment of debt
* Legal tender for Store of value
* Unit of accounting
Fiat money is the way the rich stay rich, before there were many moneys but then the powerful force to use only their money and to have it you have to borrow and pay back at interest (Douglas Rushkoff). Currency is about power not trade.

$Capitalism = Democracy + \epsilon$

Types of Capitalism

At the core the distinctions are created on the differences between the relations between the market and the state.
Now it reigns neoliberal capitalism it imposed over Keynes managing capitalism through the demand side and Polanyi's embedded capitalism (Brettom Woods). von Hayek spontaneous order and Milton Friedman pledge for minimal state, the only interference would be in the supply of money.
the new phase of capitalism was characterized by deregulation, privatization and partial deconstruction of the welfare state.

The crash between capitalism and democracy comes mainly from this edges:
* capital gains, distribution and use of property rights lead to an accumulation of wealth large enough to hinder politics through capitalist pressure (the riches buy the votes of elected representative in the congress through lobbying and other forms of bribing)
* democratic decisions are taken to massively limit the use of property rights (the fear to forms of communism governance undertaken of private assets.  Italy post WWII politics is the perfect example to our days)

The dangerous contradiction between d & c is the following whereas certain forms of capitalism (unregulated) produce and function with an extreme concentration of wealth and capital (to its natural end, monopolistic), democracies cannot coexist with a similar constellation and concentration of power, because power can be bought.
"Democracy is subordinate to the market, democracy must adjust to the market."

the hallmarks of financial capitalism are speed, volume and complexity of transaction, parliamentary democracy has, on the contrary, inertia and larger time windows for the decision making, the market has also the upper hand, it acts and reacts faster, autonomoulsy (no time in the equation because is as fast as physics allow).

It is not only naive but ignorant on the laws of physics to assume that any political decision could keep pace with the speed of financial transactions.

 Revolutions – especially in the United States (1776) and France (1789) – helped to create the idea of a commonly defined ‘national interest’, while improved communications unified language, culture and identity.
 Imperialistic expansion spread the nation-state model worldwide and by mid 20th century was the only game in town. There are 193 states in the world. But for how long this anomaly will last? For a person living under roman law, the mighty roman
 empire would appear almost eternal (it lasted 1,000) years, or for a farmer in rural Bretagne the end of the Anciene regime a hard to   imagine   event, nobody either predicted the sudden end of the soviet bloc in 1989.

 The case against the nation state is hardly new, but internet may have, this time be different.
Libertarian utopias for the XXIcentury are Liberland, which is uninhabited but has more than 100,000 online citizens ready to move if Croatia stops blocking inward access. The problem for Liberland is that the Croatian police could roll in any time they want. Seasteading Institute, on the other hand,  plans to build island cities in ninternational watersand counts with $0.5M$ donated by Peter Thiel. Therewill create an archipuelago of seasteads all different in which "citizens" can switch from one to the next as they switch episodes of their favourite series in Netflix.

The bootom line is Nation-states are unlikely to collapse overnight. There are no barbarians at the gate. But while the nation state served a time of industrialisation, centralised ‘command and control’ bureaucracies and national loyalty. Modern technology tends in the opposite direction: it’s distributed, decentralised and uncontrollable. If our political arrangements are a mirror of the modes of production and assumptions of the time, the future doesn’t look rosy for this 19th-century relic.
