# From Teruel Curso de Verano Is technology killing capitalism
# Is capitalism compatible with democracy? Wolfgang Merkel
Capitalisma nd democracy follow ver different logic, distributed proeprty rights vs political rights.
the finanzialitation of the 80s has broken down the fragile compromises built inthe social denocracy era to oppose the red peril.
Socioecnomic inequality has risen intra nations but decrease internations, globally.
Historical evidence also confirms that no developed democracy could exist without capitalism. Vice versa this is not the case. Nazi Germany, China and Singapore and latin american dictatorships prove that capitalism can coexist without democracy.
If democracy then capitalism
But Capitalism does not imply democracy  
Therefore democracy does not cause capitalism there are other "confounding " factors that can take us to capitalism without democracy, for example an authoritarian regime like Singapure or China.
Diminishing democracies  is a concept that has been promoted since the turn of the milenium (post democracies, defective democracies or mere facades) and capitalism is usually blame for this democratic decadence.
Financial capitalism in particular raises inequalities in income and political participation, curbs the powers of parliaments and seriously constrains the capacity to govern from national executives.
The 2008 and the subsequent Euro crises have changed the perception about the apparently complementary nature of democracy and capitalism.
We may talk about varieties of capitalism and varieties of democracy, this would make the dialogue inconclusive and unproductive, because there would be always a problem of capitalism choice "a la carte" to reach the chosen democratic status
$Capitalism = Democracy + \epsilon$

Types of Capitalism

At the core the distinctions are created on the differences between the relations between the market and the state.
Now it reigns neoliberal capitalism it imposed over Keynes managing capitalism through the demand side and Polanyi's embedded capitalism (Brettom Woods). von Hayek spontaneous order and Milton Friedman pledge for minimal state, the only interference would be in the supply of money.
the new phase of capitalism was characterized by deregulation, privatization and partial deconstruction of the welfare state.

The crash between capitalism and democracy comes mainly from this edges:
* capital gains, distribution and use of property rights lead to an accumulation of wealth large enough to hinder politics through capitalist pressure (the riches buy the votes of elected representative in the congress through lobbying and other forms of bribing)
* democratic decisions are taken to massively limit the use of property rights (the fear to forms of communism governance undertaken of private assets.  Italy post WWII politics is the perfect example to our days)

Teh dangerous contradiction between d & c is the following whereas certain forms of capitalism (unregulated) produce and function with an extreme concentration of wealth and capital (to its natural end, monopolistic), democracies cannot coexist with a similar constellation and concentration of power, because power can be bought.
"Democracy is subordinate to the market, democracy must adjust to the market."

the hallmarks of financial capitalism are speed, volume and complexity of transaction, parlamentary democracy has, on the contrary, inertia and larger time windows for the decision making, the market has also the upper hand, it acts and reacts faster, autonomoulsy (no time in the equation because is as fast as physics allow).
W. Scheuermann "empire of speed", Harmut Rosa "desynchromization"  (because was too fast, history very rarely repeats, financial capitalism is the play boy and democracy is the priest in rural Spain, the former is hardly predicable the later always follow the same pattern, he is slow, history repeats itself).
It is not only naive but ignorant on the laws of physics to assume that any political decision could keep pace with the speed of  nancial transactions.
